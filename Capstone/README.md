## Project Description
The US Census conducted by the US Census Bureau is the leading source for data about the people and economy of the United States. The census collects a wealth of information about the United States. This data can be used to make predictions about income, demographics, education and employment. The goal of this project is to use the census data to develop a prediction model to predict whether a person makes over $50K per year. The data set to be used is the Census Income Data Set from the Machine Learning Repository, University of California Irvine: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income. This data was extracted from the 1994 Census database. A machine learning approach will be used to make the prediction. The machine learning technique to be used will be SVM (Support Vector Machine). SVM is particularly good for classification and regression analysis. The goal is to develop a prediction model that can be used on larger data sets and different Census years data. A report and presentation will be created showing how the solution was obtained. The report and presentation will include the code written to perform the analysis.
